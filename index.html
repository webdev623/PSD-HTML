			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.12vw;"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> General description and purpose of the test —</strong> My healthcare provider has recommended that I (or my child) receive the following  genetic  test:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text_div">
			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.5vw">•</strong> My healthcare provider has explained that the purpose of this test is to look for mutations or genetic alterations known to be associated with a genetic disease(s), condition(s), or pharmaceutical therapy, and has discussed this disease, condition or therapy with me.  I have reviewed information about this speciﬁc test and the relevant disease(s) or condition(s) tested for with my healthcare provider, and my healthcare provider has explained the test’s risks and beneﬁts.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text_div">
			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.1vw"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> Limitations of the test —</strong> This test analyzes speciﬁc gene regions and does not rule out the possibility of an issue in other gene regions. Donor DNA from transplants and recent transfusions can cause inaccurate results. As in any lab test, there is a possibility of error.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text_div">
			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.1vw"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> Availability of genetic counseling before and after testing — </strong>I have been provided with information about obtaining genetic counseling prior to giving my consent for this testing. I further understand that my healthcare provider may recommend consultation with a medical geneticist, genetic counselor, and/or a physician after the testing is completed.</p>

			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.1vw"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> Meaning of a positive test result — </strong>A positive test result is an indication that I (or my child) may be predisposed to or have the speciﬁc disease(s) or condition(s) tested for. I may wish to consider further independent testing and/or to consult a physician or genetic counselor. I further understand that the ability of genetic testing to provide information as to risk, and the level of certainty if a rest result is positive test result varies with type of test. I will ask my doctor about the level of certainty of a positive result for this test.</p>

		<div class="text_div">
			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.1vw"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> Meaning of a negative test result — </strong> A negative test result indicates that the clinically signiﬁcant variant tested was not detected. Negative results may also be due to: (1) maternal contamination of prenatal samples; (2) technical reasons (ie, poor sample quality); and/or (3) the need to test other family members. I have discussed information about the detection rate for the disease(s)/condition(s) with my healthcare provider and understand that a negative result does not guarantee that I(or my child) will not develop the disease/condition for which testing was performed.</p>

			<p class="text_p"><strong style="font-family: 'Calibri Bold',serif; font-size: 1.1vw"><span style="font-size: 1.5vw">•</span> Additional acknowledgments concerning the results of prenatal testing — </strong> I understand that normal or negative test results do not guarantee the birth of a child without the speciﬁc disease or birth defect for which testing was performed. In addition, a percentage of all pregnancies have birth defects that cannot be detected by testing chorionic villi, amniotic ﬂuid, or by ultrasound examination. In the case of twins or other multiple fetuses, the results may pertain to only one of the fetuses. In the case of abnormal or positive test results, the decision to continue or to terminate the pregnancy is entirely mine.</p>

My test results will be available to me after it has been released by my healthcare professional.</p>

The sample will be destroyed at the end of the testing process or not more than 60 days after the sample was taken, unless I expressly authorize a longer period of retention in writing.</p>
